//
// Split out from applink.js so it can be tested without Electron, and because
// it is the file where a privacy mistake would actually happen. Everything
// else in the link is plumbing; this decides what leaves the process.
//
// The rule: **counts, never content.**
//
//   • The transcript is a recording of a conversation other people are part of
//     and did not agree to share. A turn count and a timestamp let Iris tell
//     "transcription is working" from "transcription is silently dead", which
//     is all it needs. The words never leave.
//   • The résumé is the user's own history, and its presence is the only
//     diagnostic fact about it.
//   • Whether an API key is set is a diagnosis. The key is a liability.
